> Prerequisite : you'll need the 'tabulizer' package to run this code. All instructions to download the package are available on https://github.com/ropensci/tabulizer.

# Load data
We want to extract information for all the stocks evaluated by the "working group on elasmobranch species".The stocks' list we use for data extraction comes from an excel file dowloaded on the ICES website : <https://sid.ices.dk/Default.aspx>. You simply have to select "export as excel".   
```{r data}
#import the excel file
WGEF <- read_excel("data\\FilteredStocklist_WGEF.xlsx") %>% rename(Stock = `Stock Key Label`)

#extract list of stocks
stocks <- WGEF$Stock
```

# Download the latest stock advice files from the ices website published since 2018
It's possible thanks to their straightforward url: .../year/year/stock.pdf !  

*If you want to keep ALL files published since 2018, simply add the year [i] in the file name to keep (for instance by adding "_", i, in the paste argument. There is for sure a faster way to run this loop and to store only the latest file instead of overwriting. Since I needed to do it only once, I kept the easy version that worked.*

```{r}
for(i in 2018:2022){
  for(j in 1:length(stocks)){
    stock <- stocks[j]
    url <- paste("https://www.ices.dk/sites/pub/Publication%20Reports/Advice/",i, "/", i, "/", stock, ".pdf", sep = "")
    
    #check if url exists
    if(url.exists(url)==T){
       download.file(url, paste("ICES_advice\\", stock, ".pdf", sep =""), mode = "wb")
    }
}
}
```

# Extract info from all files
  
The 'extract_table' function from the 'tabulizer' package extracts tables from pdf files. However, it's not perfect and there are many possible errors. The loop below has several 'if' statements to cover all possible scenarios of error (mainly: not detecting the columns). Still, the final dataset contains error and will need to be checked and corrected by hand...  

## Extract stock category
```{r stock_category}
#initialize empty tibble
ICES_stock_cat <- tibble()

##loop over species
for(j in 1:length(stocks)){
  #select the stock
  stock <- stocks[j]
  stock_file <- paste("ICES_advice\\", stock, ".pdf", sep ="")
  
  #extract all tables
  stock_list <- extract_tables(
    file   = stock_file, 
    method = "decide", 
    output = "data.frame")
  

  stock_list_match <- stock_list[grepl("ICES.stock.data.category" , stock_list, fixed = T)] #match pattern
  
  #turn to tibble and extract the colname
  if(length(stock_list_match) > 0){
   stock_category <- stock_list_match[[1]] %>% as_tibble() %>% 
    colnames() %>% str_extract(pattern="[[:digit:]]") %>% as_tibble() %>% drop_na() %>% pull(value) 
  } else{
    stock_category <- NA #in case it didn't find the pattern
  }
   
  #bind with stock
  stock_category <- cbind(stock, stock_category) %>% as_tibble()
  
  #bind with big df
  ICES_stock_cat <- bind_rows(ICES_stock_cat, stock_category)
}

#there are some where it extracted two values
ICES_stock_cat <- ICES_stock_cat %>% group_by(stock) %>% summarise(stock_category = first(stock_category))
  
#export as csv
write.csv(ICES_stock_cat, "data/ICES_stock_category.csv")
```

## Extract status history
```{r status_history}
